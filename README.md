# Supermarket App
// This app will be valuable for supermarkets to get customers to see what kinds of food they have. It will also be valuable for the employees to learn more about profits and avaliable stock. The user base will be customers at a supermarket, as well as the employees of the supermarket. Our app will have 2 sides: the user side and an administrator side. For a user, they will be able to look up products and see the full name of the product, the manufacturer, and a short description of the product. For an administrator, they will be able to see everything that the user sees, in addition to the total amount of an item left in the store as well as the wholesale price and amount of profit that the store is making.
